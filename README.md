# cosmetic-brand-predictor
This is a project to practice applying random forest onto a dataset. The objective is to train a random forest model so that we can enter a set of sample inputs (the user's preferences) and have the model recommend us a cosmetic brand to purchase from. The dataset to be used is [Top Beauty & Cosmetics Products Worldwide 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/most-used-beauty-cosmetics-products-in-the-world).
